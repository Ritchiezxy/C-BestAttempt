Later on, I will store some cute and very useful C++ code piece at here. 
I wish they will be best practices in C++ Language grammer, also I wish they will be the kind of that are useful but short.
Each and every code piece well be show with a brief  introduction in an ABC file in the directory of ABC file belongs to.
